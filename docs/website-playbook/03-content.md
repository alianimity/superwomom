# 03 · Content Strategy & Legal-Safe Standards

## Voice & Tone
- Confident, clear, benefit-led
- Avoid jargon unless the audience expects it (Tech)
- Emphasize outcomes and safety (Health)

## Claims Policy (Industry-Agnostic)
- Prefer “experienced, qualified, trained” over “licensed/certified” unless verified
- If licensing is required (Health/Trades), state: “Work requiring specialized credentials is performed by appropriately qualified partners.”

## Testimonials & Social Proof
- Use personal names; avoid company names unless approved
- Use city/region for context, not exact addresses

## Numbers & Stats
- Use realistic ranges (e.g., “500+ projects”, “10+ years” only if true)
- Keep consistent across all pages/components

## Legal Pages
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy mandatory
- Data processing and contact policy transparency

## Content Blocks
- Trust signals (3–4 items), feature lists, clear CTAs
- Nationwide or regional scope stated accurately

## Industry Notes
- Tech: security, uptime, compliance (SOC2, ISO) only if verified
- Health: disclaimers, scope-of-practice, HIPAA where applicable
- Services: safety training, quality control, subcontractor oversight
