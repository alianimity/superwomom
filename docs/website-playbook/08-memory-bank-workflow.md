# 08 · Memory Bank Workflow

## Purpose
- Persist decisions, context, and progress across sessions/teams

## Files
- projectbrief.md – scope and goals
- productContext.md – problem/solution, audience
- systemPatterns.md – architecture decisions and patterns
- techContext.md – stack, constraints
- activeContext.md – current work, recent changes, next steps
- progress.md – what works, what’s left

## Update Triggers
- After significant changes, new patterns, or scope updates
- Before handoff or deployment

## Best Practices
- Keep entries concise but specific
- Record rationales, not just outcomes
- Capture pitfalls and resolutions for reuse
