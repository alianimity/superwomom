# Website + Shopify Playbook (Industry-Agnostic)

Purpose: A reusable, end-to-end playbook to plan, design, build, and launch a modern website (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind) and optionally generate a Shopify catalog. This guide is industry-agnostic and includes sector notes (Tech, Health, Home Services) and legal-safe content patterns.

Modules:
- 01-setup.md – Stack, repo, conventions, local/dev setup

- 03-content.md – Voice/tone, claims policy, trust, legal pages
- 04-build-architecture.md – App Router structure, components, pages
- 05-shopify-catalog.md – Optional: products/variants CSV playbook
- 06-qa-and-troubleshooting.md – Build, lint, UI, content QA
- 07-deployment.md – Envs, build, Vercel, post-launch checks
- 08-memory-bank-workflow.md – Documentation and decision tracking
- 09-templates.md – Reusable code blocks and page skeletons
- 10-contact-and-legal-requirements.md – Contact patterns and legal compliance

Who this is for: Product/brand teams and engineers creating professional, consistent, legally-safe, high-converting sites across industries.
