## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Brand Colors (UPDATED)

- **Support**: #E5DFCE (light support color requiring dark text)
- **Implementation**: Updated all UI components to work with light support color

### Service Page Architecture
Consistent pattern established for all service pages:
```
Hero → Overview → What's Included (6 cards) → Pricing (3-4 tiers) → Special Card → CTA → Related Services
```

### Pricing Strategy Implementation
- **Standard services**: $500-$5,000 range clearly communicated
- **Premium specialized**: $10,000-$50,000+ range with value justification
- **Service-specific ranges**: Each service shows appropriate pricing tier

### Content Strategy Execution

- **Contact Accessibility**: Dual email system and prominent phone access

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Patterns Established
- **Cards**: Light background (#E5DFCE) with dark text for readability
- **Buttons**: Primary (#C54365) with white text, outline with hover states
